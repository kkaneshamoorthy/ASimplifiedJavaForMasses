# A Simplified Java For Masses
## A simplified java for the masses, natural programming language

Learning to program can be tough for people. It requires a considerable amount of effort and time to
practice and without some understanding of how a computer works, it can be daunting at first. The
aim my project is to break the barrier/perception that is preventing people from learning to code. I
want to make it easy for people to get into programming by removing unnecessary syntax and create
a programming language that is similar to a natural language. To put it in simple terms, I want to
simplify the programming language (Java) to get people into coding.


The main aim is to spread programming to children and inspire them. I want this simplified Java to be
used at school to teach and get children into coding. This will inspire them to become a computer
scientist, innovator, programmer or pursue a science and engineering related field in the future.


## Simplified Java

### Output
print <values to print>

### Input
