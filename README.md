# A Simplified Java For Masses
## A simplified java for the masses, natural programming language

Learning to program can be tough for people. It requires a considerable amount of effort and time to
practice and without some understanding of how a computer works, it can be daunting at first. The
aim my project is to break the barrier/perception that is preventing people from learning to code. I
want to make it easy for people to get into programming by removing unnecessary syntax and create
a programming language that is similar to a natural language. To put it in simple terms, I want to
simplify the programming language (Java) to get people into coding.


The main aim is to spread programming to children and inspire them. I want this simplified Java to be
used at school to teach and get children into coding. This will inspire them to become a computer
scientist, innovator, programmer or pursue a science and engineering related field in the future.


## Simplified Java code
The compiler recongnises natural language and it doesnt have to follow a regid structure. For example a loop can be written in many ways. For example:

```javascript
write a program to loop 3 times and print "hello world"
```

OR
```javascript
loop 3
  print "hello world"
```
OR

```javascript
loop 3 times
  print "hello world" to the console
```
The above program in Java:

```java
public class Program {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
      System.out.println("hello world");
    }
  }
}
```
You can see that its daunting and will be confusing for people who starting to learn programming and for children. Therefore the simplified Java lets you program in natural language and introduces you to the programming concepts in an abstract and easy to understand manner.

### Writing loops:
loop &lt; number of iterations &gt;

### Condition
if &lt; expression &gt;

### Function
function &lt; function name &gt;:

### Output
print &lt; values to print &gt;

### Input
input &lt; optional: location of input {console, file} &gt;

### Variable
$ &lt; variable name> = &lt; value &gt;

## Key features
1. Conversion to Java code
2. Drag and Drop style programming (editor also available)
3. Tutorials
4. Run code
